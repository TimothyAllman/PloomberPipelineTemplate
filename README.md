## Description

<!-- start description -->
The purpose of this template is to serve as a useful starting point for any data science pipeline that I want to begin. Most importantly it contains things which I find particularly useful when creating data science pipelines/models that will exist for a long time, such as step-by-step and FAQ documents generation via (nbconvert) and final report generation using python-ppttx which use plotly for graphs as well as pipeline/DAG plotting via ploombers API so that one can very easily see the end-to-end flow of ones project. It also contains things such as `RunMe` and `InstallMe` notebooks which I have found useful for development and in making things more accessible for less technical audiences. It illustrates a lot of the benefits that I think adoption of Ploomber brings about in my use cases and thus can be seen as a sort of "everything/all-in-one/showcase-every-feature-that-ploomber-can-do" project.  

Hopefully its useful to other as well
